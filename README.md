# public_Api
 
Project Overview: This is TechDegree's 5th project. This takes in 12 random users from randomuser Api and displays data to the page. I was able to update the CSS to add the color but I was not able to figure out how to toggle between modals. The search bar is displayed on the page but currently does not work. Lastly I will need to work on refactoring the code to look more consise and clean. The main functionality for the project works as intended.

Skills:
javascript, CSS 

Future updates
